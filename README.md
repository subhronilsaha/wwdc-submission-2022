## What is it about?

This is my Swift Playground app Submission for WWDC 2022 Swift Student Challenge!

This is an interactive playground to see how Bezier curves work in action!

We explore the three types of Bezier curves - Linear, Quadratic & Cubic - and how they create their respective curves using control points! There's also an exercise where we use these curves to make a fun drawing!
